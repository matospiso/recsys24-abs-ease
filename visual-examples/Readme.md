# Case study from the online evaluation
In addition to the case displayed in the paper (Figure 3), we provide several additional examples of how the original and proposed methods differ from each other. The examples are grouped into three clusters: easy cases, hard cases, and cases containing dislikes.

- In easy cases, we have ample feedback on relatively popular items, therefore the results of both original method and proposed modifications are negligible
- In hard cases, we either have few feedback records, or this contain less items or items from highly diverse category. This result in the inability of the original method to provide a sufficient volume of recommendations and these has to be filled-in using a non-personalzed approach
- In dislike cases, the original method often amplifies the scores of items very similar to the disliked one. In contrast, this behavior was not observed for the proposed modifications.
